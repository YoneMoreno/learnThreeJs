#Three.js basic examples

This repository contains all the examples from my [Pluralsight three.js course](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/webgl-threejs-fundamentals).

Three.JS Frogger game is held in its own repository at [github.com/alexmackey/threeJsFrogger](https://github.com/alexmackey/threeJsFrogger). 

For more information please refer to [simpleisbest.co.uk/threejscourse](http://www.simpleisbest.co.uk/threejscourse) or contact me via twitter at [@alexjmackey](http://www.twitter.com/alexjmackey) . 

The examples were created against three.js r67 version.

Thanks to the [three.js team](http://threejs.org) for producing such an awesome library :)
